Hello interwebnets!!

I used to have this on [[http://sudowork.wordpress.com][wordpress]] but I decided
this is much more practical and hip. So I am greeting you world from
my awesome new SudoWorkV2 blog.

Here is some code:

#+NAME: hello_world.py
#+BEGIN_SRC python
def hello_to_you(world):
    print "Hello world"
#+END_SRC
