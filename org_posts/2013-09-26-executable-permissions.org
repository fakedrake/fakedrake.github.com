There are some emacs commands that I call interactively only to use a
small subset of their functionality which means more keystrokes and
zoning out for a bit (interuption = check reddit). Prominent examples
of this are rename-file and chmod. Not anymore though! WIth this
command you give executable permissions to everyone on the current
file!

#+NAME: Make current file executable
#+BEGIN_SRC scm
(defun chmod+x-this ()
  "Add executable permissions to the current file."
  (interactive)
  (if buffer-file-name
      (let ((new-mode (logior #o111 (file-modes buffer-file-name))))
	(set-file-modes buffer-file-name new-mode))
    (message "No such file to make executable.")))
#+END_SRC
