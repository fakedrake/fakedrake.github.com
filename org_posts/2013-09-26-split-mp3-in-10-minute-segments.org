Here is how to divide an mp3 file into 10 minute segments with bash
and ffmpeg:

#+NAME: Split audio in 10m segments.
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
for i in {0..$LENGTH_IN_SECONDS..600}; do
	ffmpeg -i input_file.mp3 -ss $i -t 600 output.pt$(($i/600)).mp3;
done
#+END_SRC

I used this for an audio book that was in a humongous 6 hour file that
sucks because my mp3 player doesnt support bookmarking.
