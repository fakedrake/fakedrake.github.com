#+END_HTML

Hello everyone!,

I was browsing some addons the other day being bored out of my mind
and alongside all the useless trash you normally find on the add-ons
page of firefox i found a diamond.

At last the days where it was either dealing with the clipboard system
of Xorg or dealing with the extremely basic editing functionality that
web browsers provide for text input are over. It’s all text is here to
save the endless cursing that came along with editing html in Joomla!
or writing anything online that required a TAB or having to watch out
not to use any of your vim or emacs keybindings. This addon will let
you edit whatever you are editing in your favorte editor and then pipe
it back to the input box!

In the Preferences of the add-on you can select your favourite
editor(if you haven’t defined so in an EDITOR variable) and the
keybinding to use to get there. When you use it click on the small
blue button that appears or use the key you defined(only problem this
doesn’t work with vimperator, i will update if i find a
solution). When you are done kill the editor(or emacs client in my
case(using C-x #)) and you will find that whatever change you made is
now in the input box. :D

EDIT: I swiched to pentadactyl wich is much faster and smarter than
vimperator so I suggest you do that aswell. I am not sure if
vimperator has this aswell but C-i in pentadactyl fires up the text
editor found in pentadactyl’s editor variable(gvim is the default)
without the need of all is text! Quite nice.
